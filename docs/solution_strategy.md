# Hackathon Solution Strategy

## Core Requirements (from transcript)

### 1. Program Functionality
- Must process input CSV files:
  - payments_1.csv, payments_2.csv (payment transactions)
  - providers_1.csv, providers_2.csv (provider states)
  - exchange_rates.csv (currency conversion rates)
- Must output payment files with additional "flow" column showing provider chain (e.g. "1-2-3")
- Must be easily runnable (Docker preferred or clear instructions)
- Must work reliably without environment dependencies
- Should process test data sets beyond provided samples

### 2. Key Optimization Parameters
- **Profit Optimization**
  - Maximize profit in USD (transaction amount minus provider commission)
  - Consider provider commission rates
  - Account for minimum limit penalties (1% of limit if not met)
  
- **Conversion Rate**
  - Target realistic conversion rates (80-90% mentioned as standard)
  - Balance between high conversion and other factors
  - Consider chain conversion effects (multiple providers)

- **Processing Time**
  - Minimize total processing time for user satisfaction
  - Consider chain length impact on total time
  - Find optimal balance between time and conversion

### 3. Dynamic Adaptation
- Must handle changing provider states over time:
  - Conversion rates
  - Processing times
  - Commission rates
  - Limits
- Adjust routing based on current provider states
- Consider historical performance
